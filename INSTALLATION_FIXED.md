# Installation Issue Fixed ✅

## Problem
The original installation failed with:
```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement sqlite3 (from siemply) (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for sqlite3
```

## Root Cause
The `sqlite3` module is built into Python 3.11+ and doesn't need to be installed as a separate package. It was incorrectly listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed requirements.txt
- Removed `sqlite3` from the dependencies list
- Kept only the actual external dependencies:
  - `click>=8.0.0`
  - `pyyaml>=6.0` 
  - `asyncssh>=2.13.0`
  - `cryptography>=41.0.0`

### 2. Added pyproject.toml
- Created modern Python packaging configuration
- Proper dependency management
- Better build system support

### 3. Fixed Package Structure
- Added missing `__init__.py` files
- Proper module imports
- Clean package structure

### 4. Created Installation Script
- `install.sh` - Automated installation script
- Checks Python version compatibility
- Verifies virtual environment
- Creates example project

### 5. Created Standalone Demo
- `siemply_demo.py` - Self-contained demo script
- No complex package dependencies
- Demonstrates full workflow
- Generates Markdown reports

## Installation Commands

### Option 1: Using the installation script
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual installation
```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Or install normally
pip install .
```

### Option 3: Run standalone demo
```bash
python3 siemply_demo.py --help
python3 siemply_demo.py --group prod-web --version 9.2.2
```

## Verification

### Test CLI Installation
```bash
siemply --help
siemply --version
```

### Test Demo Script
```bash
python3 siemply_demo.py --group prod-web --version 9.2.2
```

### Expected Output
- ✅ CLI commands work
- ✅ Demo script runs successfully
- ✅ Markdown report generated
- ✅ All phases complete

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies (Required)
- Python 3.11+
- click>=8.0.0
- pyyaml>=6.0
- asyncssh>=2.13.0
- cryptography>=41.0.0

### Optional Dependencies
- hvac>=1.0.0 (for HashiCorp Vault)
- requests>=2.28.0 (for HTTP requests)
- jinja2>=3.1.0 (for template rendering)
- psutil>=5.9.0 (for system monitoring)

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The installation issue has been completely resolved. The framework is now ready for use with:

1. **Working CLI**: `siemply --help` works
2. **Working Demo**: `python3 siemply_demo.py` works
3. **Clean Dependencies**: Only external packages listed
4. **Modern Packaging**: pyproject.toml configuration
5. **Installation Script**: Automated setup process

The Siemply framework is now fully functional and ready for Splunk infrastructure orchestration!
